📊 ClicRates — CTR & A/B Testing Analyzer

ClicRates is a lightweight analytics tool designed to evaluate Click-Through Rates (CTR) for multiple headlines/variants using statistical methods.
A simple and effective tool for analyzing Click-Through Rates (CTR) of different headlines to determine which version performs best.



🔍 What is Click-Through Rate (CTR)?

Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a measurement that tells how many people clicked on something after seeing it.

It is calculated as:

CTR = (Number of Clicks) / (Total Views)


CTR helps us understand:

How attractive a headline or ad is

Which version performs better in an A/B test

How users respond to different content variations

Whether a change improves engagement

Higher CTR = More user interest.

🎯 Why Do We Analyze CTR?

CTR analysis is essential because it helps answer questions like:

Which headline is most effective?

Are the differences between headlines statistically meaningful?

Is the improvement real or just due to randomness?

Which version should be used in marketing or UI decisions?

In marketing, product design, and advertising, small CTR improvements can lead to huge increases in conversions and revenue.
